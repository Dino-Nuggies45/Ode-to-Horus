                        The story of Horus is one of the most enduring and influenction myths of ancient Egypt blending themes of divine kingship, cosmic balance,  and the eternal struggle between order and chaos. Horus, the falcon-headed god, was central to Egyptian religion, embodying protection, legitimacy, and the triumph of good over evil. His conflict with Set and his role as the rightful heir of Osiris became the foundation for Egyptian rulership and spiritual symbolism.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Horus, one of ancient Egypt's principal deities, was worshipped as a falcon or a man with a falcons head. He embodied the sky, kingship, and protection. His major myth focuses on the struggle against Set to avenge Osiris and restore cosmic order known as maat. The Eye of Horus, or Wedjat, emerged from this confict as a symbol of healing, restoration, and safeguarding. Widely used from the Old Kingdom through the Roman period, it appears in art, amulets, and hieroglyphs as a token of protection and divine health.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="genealogy">Genealogy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Horus is the son of Isis and Osiris, placing him at the heart of the Osirian myth cycle, which revolves around themes of kingship, death, resurrection, and justice. Pharaohs claimed descent from Horus, legitimizing their rule with divine authority.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="major-myths">Major Myths</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the earliest Pyramid Texts(Old Kingdom), the conflict between Horus and Set is prominent. The myth includes the theft anmd restoration of Horus's eye, sometimes paired with Set losing his manhood. These conflicts are about legitimacy, cosmic balance, and teh restoration of order.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="eye-of-horus">Eye of Horus: the story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Set injuresor steal Horus's eye during their cosmic combat. Thoth or in some versions Hathor or Isis restores it, sometimes even assembling it from pieces(the myth varies). After restoration teh eye symbolizes healing, completeness, and renewal. Thoth is sometimes said to have "filled" the eye using magical substances or plants, equating the process to teh waxing moon.
                    </p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        The restored eye of Horus not only healed his wound but became a universal symbol of renewal, balance, and protection throughout Egypt.
                    </div>

                    <p class="muted">Mathematical note: The Eye of Horus was also connected to a fractional system used by the Egyptians. Each part of the eye represented a fraction(1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64), which when combined nearly totaled 1. This was interpreted as the divine completeness restored by Horus, and was used as a teaching tool for measuring and fractions in daily Egyptian mathematics.</p>

                    <p>
                        The Eye of Horus(left, lunar) represents protection, healing, and restoration. The Eye of Ra (right, solar) represents power, wrath, and divine retribution. Early texts blur the distinction, but over time they became differentiated, Horus's being lunar and benign Ra's being solar and often aggressive.

                        <p>
                            Versions of Horus's story vary across Egypt's long dynastic history, reflecting regional traditions, temple politics, and evolving religious thought. In one common version, Horus is born from Isis after the death of Osiris, raised in secret to protect him from Set. When he comes of age, Horus challenges Set for the rightful throne of Egypt. Their conflict spans not only physical battles but legal disputes judges by the Ennead, the council of gods. Some texts describe Set attempting to discredit Horus by trickery, while others recount their combat in the desert or the Nile marshes. The myth concludes with Horus's eventual triumph, though in certain traditions, Set is not destroyed but given a role guarding Ra's solar boat, symbolizing the transformation of chaos into servant of order.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Ritual fragments</h4>
                        <p>
                            Archeological finds suggest that parts of Horus's myth were enacted in ritual drama during temple festivals. Reliefs from Edfu Temple, for example, preserve scenes of Horus's battle against Set in ceremonial form, where priests would reenact the god's victories as sacred theater. Magical papyri also contain invocations referencing the "Eye of Horus restored" which were recited for healing and protection. These ritual fragments demonstrated how myth, religion, and daily practice intertwined in Egyptian culture ensure Horus's narrative was not distant legend but a living and repeated act of cosmic renewal.
