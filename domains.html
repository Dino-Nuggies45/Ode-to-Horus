                    Horus's divine authority stretched across mutiple domains that refkected both his mythic battles and his daily importance to the lives of Egyptians. He was the falcon who ruled the sky, the avenger who upheld kingship and justice, the warrior who crushed chaos, and the protector who watched over the land and its people. His domains were not limited to one sphere of life but tied together cosmic order, political legitimacy, and personal safety
                </p>

                <h2 id="sky">Domain of the Sky</h2>
                <p>
                    As a sky god, Horus's eye were linked to the sun adn moon, ensuring the eternal cycle of light and darkness. His falcon form represented dominon over the heavens, and the flight was a symbol of far-seeing vision and divine protection. The sky was not only his dwelling place but also his realm of power, connecting his presence to both the natural world and the cosmic order.
                </p>

                <h2 id="kingship">Kingship</h2>
                <p>
                    Horus's kingship was centeral to Egyptian ideology. Every pharaoh was seen as a living Horus, inheriting his authority as ruler of the Two Lands. Kingship under Horus meant more than political control, it was a sacred duty to maintain ma'at, the balance of truth and order. Coronation rituals invoked him the rightful heir to Osiris, affirmation that each king continued the eternal cycle of divine rulership.
                </p>

                <h2 id="protection">Protection</h2>
                <p>
                    Horus was a guardian of Egypt, protecting both its borders and its moral function. Through his trails against Set, he became a symbol of justice, proving that rightful rule must be defended in both combot and in the judgment of the gods. The Eye of Horus was a powerful emblem of protection, worn as amulets by kings and commoners alike to ensure health, safety, and justice.
                </p>

                <h2 id="war">War & Vengeance</h2>
                <p>
                    The mythic battles between Horus and Set established his role as a god of war and triumph. He embodied the righteous conqueror who defended Egypt from chaos and foreign threat. Kings identified themselves with Horus before entering battle, claiming victory not only by might but by divine legitimacy. His triumphs were celebrated as victories of order over disorder, reinforcing the belief that every war fought under Horus's blessing was a just one. 
                </p>

                <h2 id="ritual">Ritual Presence</h2>
                <p>
                    Horus's domains were reinforced through ritual practice in temples. At Edfu, festicals reencacted his battles with Set, allowing Egyptians to relive the victory of order over chaos each year. Priests invoked the healing power of his Eye in protective spells, and offerings ensured his favor for both the king and the people. Rituals tied his cosmic domains to daily life, keeping his power active within society.
                </p>

                <h2 id="iconography">Iconography</h2>
                <p>
                    Horus was most often depicted as a falcon or a falcon-headed man crowned with the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. His eyes, one solar and one lunar, become among the most enduring symbols of protection and restoration in Egyptian art. In battle scenes, horus appeared as a fierce warrior, spearing enemies who represented disorder. In temples reliefs, he stood beside Osiris and Isis, completeing the divine family and reinforcing his legitimacy as heir and ruler.
