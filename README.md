🏛️ Ode to Horus

Welcome to Ode to Horus, a wiki-style website I built to explore, celebrate, and bring to life the symbols and mythology of Horus, one of ancient Egypt’s most fascinating gods.

🎯 Why I Made This

I wanted to create a space where learning about ancient Egyptian culture is fun, interactive, and visually appealing. Rather than a boring textbook-style page, I wanted something that:

Shows the story behind each symbol of Horus.

Makes history feel alive through visuals and interactive content.

Adds a modern twist to ancient myths, including a mini rhythm game.

✨ Goals

Educate visitors about Horus, his symbols, and sacred animals.

Engage users with interactive content like the rhythm game.

Experiment with web design, blending classical aesthetics with modern web interactivity.

Serve as a portfolio piece showing my creativity, coding, and design skills.

🚀 Features

🗂 Wiki-style layout: Organized sections with headings and a table of contents.

🖼 Infoboxes: Key facts about Horus and his symbols with images for quick reference.

🎨 Rich styling: Elegant colors, smooth gradients, and a clean, readable design.

🎮 Rhythm game: A fun interactive feature where players can tap along to music, tying modern play to ancient themes.
